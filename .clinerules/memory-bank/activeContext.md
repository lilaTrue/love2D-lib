# Active Context: Love2D Library Collection

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Focus Areas
- **Library Maintenance**: Ensuring all three core libraries (SceneManager, ClassManager, CollisionManager) are stable and well-documented
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Expanding documentation with more detailed examples and best practices
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and implementing performance improvements for Lua environment
- **Community Feedback**: Incorporating user feedback and feature requests

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Documentation Updates**: Complete API documentation for all libraries
2. **Example Expansion**: Add more comprehensive examples demonstrating advanced usage
3. **Performance Testing**: Establish performance benchmarks and optimization targets
4. **Cross-Platform Verification**: Ensure compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Recent Changes

### Library Updates
- **SceneManager**: Implemented stack-based scene management with push/pop functionality
- **ClassManager**: Added mixin support and Love2D-specific class templates
- **CollisionManager**: Added Unity-style collision state tracking (enter/stay/exit)

### Documentation Improvements
- Created comprehensive README with project overview and usage examples
- Added detailed API documentation in `docs/` directory
- Included standalone examples in `example/` folder for each library

### Project Structure
- Organized code into modular `lib/` directory
- Separated documentation into `docs/` folder
- Created independent example projects for testing

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Review and update all documentation files
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks to examples
- [ ] Test libraries on different operating systems
- [ ] Create additional usage examples

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 months)
- [ ] Implement additional collision shapes (polygon, custom)
- [ ] Add scene transition effects and animations
- [ ] Create tutorial series for beginners
- [ ] Establish automated testing framework

### Long-term (3+ months)
- [ ] Develop additional libraries (AudioManager, InputManager, etc.)
- [ ] Create visual editor tools
- [ ] Build community contribution guidelines
- [ ] Establish performance monitoring tools

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design**: Each library remains independent to allow selective usage
- **Love2D Integration**: Deep integration with Love2D's callback system vs. standalone operation
- **Performance vs. Features**: Balance between feature richness and runtime performance

### API Design Considerations
- **Consistency**: Maintain similar patterns across all libraries
- **Extensibility**: Design APIs that can be easily extended without breaking changes
- **Error Handling**: Decide between silent failures and explicit error reporting

### Documentation Strategy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include API reference, examples, and best practices
- **Multiple Formats**: Markdown for readability, potentially generated docs for reference
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basics, provide advanced topics separately

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Style
- **Naming Conventions**: CamelCase for classes and functions, lowercase for variables
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic, comprehensive function documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with meaningful error messages

### Development Workflow
- **Testing**: Manual testing with Love2D runtime, focus on visual verification
- **Version Control**: Feature branches for new development, descriptive commit messages
- **Documentation**: Update docs alongside code changes

### Performance Priorities
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS target for smooth gameplay
- **Memory Usage**: Minimize garbage collection pressure
- **CPU Efficiency**: Optimize hot paths and frequently called functions

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
- **Lua OOP**: Custom class system provides better Love2D integration than third-party libraries
- **Event Forwarding**: Automatic callback delegation simplifies scene management significantly
- **Collision States**: Unity-style state tracking enables more sophisticated game mechanics

### Project Management Insights
- **Modular Libraries**: Independent libraries allow users to adopt incrementally
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Standalone examples reduce support burden and demonstrate usage
- **Documentation Investment**: Upfront documentation investment pays dividends in user adoption

### Community Feedback
- **Scene Management**: Most requested feature for complex game state handling
- **Collision Detection**: Unity-style states particularly appreciated by experienced developers
- **Class System**: OOP support helps developers coming from other languages

### Performance Insights
- **Table Operations**: Minimize table creation in update loops
- **Local Variables**: Cache globals to reduce lookup overhead
- **Memory Pools**: Object reuse reduces garbage collection frequency

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across operating systems
- **Performance Monitoring**: Establishing reliable performance benchmarks
- **Memory Management**: Balancing convenience with memory efficiency

### Documentation Challenges
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Maintaining up-to-date documentation for all features
- **Example Quality**: Creating examples that demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- **Beginner Accessibility**: Making complex concepts accessible to new Love2D developers

### Community Challenges
- **Feature Requests**: Balancing feature requests with project scope
- **Support Load**: Managing community questions and issues
- **Contribution Onboarding**: Making it easy for others to contribute
