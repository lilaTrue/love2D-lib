# Project Brief: Love2D Library Collection

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive collection of Lua libraries designed to streamline and enhance Love2D game development. It provides high-quality, reusable components that address common game development challenges, enabling developers to focus on creating unique gameplay experiences.

## Core Objectives
- Develop production-ready libraries for Love2D framework
- Create a robust ecosystem of modular, extensible tools
- Provide seamless integration with Love2D's callback system
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and examples
- Ensure performance optimization for Lua environment

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Scene management, object-oriented programming system, collision detection
- **Out of Scope**: Game-specific logic, asset management, networking (unless integrated into core libraries)

## Success Criteria
- Libraries are modular and can be used independently
- Each library includes comprehensive documentation
- Performance is optimized for Love2D's Lua environment
- Examples demonstrate real-world usage scenarios
- Code follows Lua best practices and Love2D conventions

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core libraries (SceneManager, ClassManager, CollisionManager) - COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Additional libraries and enhancements - ONGOING
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features and optimizations - FUTURE

## Key Stakeholders
- Primary: Love2D game developers seeking reusable components
- Secondary: Open source community for contributions and feedback

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Love2D 11.0+
- Libraries must be lightweight and performant
- Code must follow Lua 5.1+ standards
- Documentation must be comprehensive and accessible
